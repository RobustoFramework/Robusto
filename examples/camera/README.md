# Camera Example

This example takes the esp32-camera library and takes a picture.

Actually, this example doesn't use much of the Robusto framework except from the logging and show how a Kconfig file can be easily created to configure the application.

In this case, we actually move the internally provide config out to be used in the main config. 

Something that we can use Robusto to provide not only for the ESP-IDF platform.
