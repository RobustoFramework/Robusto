# Conductor example
The [Conductor](/components/robusto/conductor/README.md) helps peers in a network to save energy by synchronizing their wake up times.

For example, if the entire network of peers can fall asleep at the same time, client peers will perceive the conductor as always on.
In reality, it will instead be sleeping be sleeping along the rest, minimizing power draw.
