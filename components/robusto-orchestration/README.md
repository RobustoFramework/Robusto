# Robusto orchestration - Work in progress
This is the implementation of the Robusto orchestration.
## Purpose
For devices in a network to be able to conserve energy, they need to go down in low-energy modes and shut down some aspects, like networking.<br />
The orchestration enables devices to be synchronized so that they can wake up at the same time.
