            This enables the conductor service, and causes the conductor to go into deep sleep when the wake time is over. 
            The conductor enables the network to save energy by timing the sleeping of peers.

            help
                Note that this is the time between wake ups, which must be a constant cycle.
                It is not when it falls a sleep and how long, that depends on if it had to stay awake extra for some reason.

            help 
                This is how many seconds the server is awake if not asked to extend its time awake.
                Note that ROBUSTO_CONDUCTOR_SERVER_MARGIN_S (default 4) is subtracted from this value.

                A MCU will need both a short time to shut down (turning stuff off), and booting up. 
                This margin will be cause the MCU to enter sleep mode earlier to have time to

                This is the MAC-address of the conductor
                Write it as a large number, for example 0x01AB11BB12BC (6*8 bits)
